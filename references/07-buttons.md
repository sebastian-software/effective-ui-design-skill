# Buttons

Learn how to design descriptive and accessible buttons with a clear visual hierarchy.

## Define 3 Button Weights

3 weights to indicate importance of actions:

### Primary Button
- Rectangle with rounded corners
- Solid fill of brand colour
- White text
- Most prominent
- Highlights most important action

### Secondary Button
- Unfilled rectangle with border and rounded corners
- Brand colour for text and border (consistency with interactive elements)
- Avoid solid fill of another colour (conflicts with primary)
- Avoid light grey fill/outline (looks disabled)

### Tertiary Button
- Transparent button
- Underlined text (like text link)
- Brand colour for text
- Underline ensures colour blind users know it's interactive

## Common Button Design Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Low contrast fill
Secondary button fill contrast < 3:1 is too low to clearly indicate button shape.

### Mistake 2: Grey secondary button
- Could be mistaken as disabled
- Text/border contrast < 4.5:1 / 3:1

### Mistake 3: Similar primary/secondary styles
- Conflicting visual hierarchy
- Colour blind can't differentiate
- Contrast between buttons < 3:1

### Mistake 4: Similar styles, different colours
- Primary/secondary conflict
- Secondary text contrast too low

### Mistake 5: Too similar contrast
- Buttons too similar for low vision users
- Contrast ratio between buttons < 3:1

### Mistake 6: Low contrast tertiary border
- Border must be 3:1 to identify as interactive

### Mistake 7: Colour-only tertiary indicator
- Colour blind can't distinguish from plain text
- Must have underline

### Mistake 8: Inconsistent button shapes
- If shapes differ, users assume different function
- Elements with same function should look same

### Mistake 9: Unclear hierarchy
- Primary and secondary have similar visual weight
- Secondary background < 3:1 contrast

## Button Design Guidelines

1. Clear visual hierarchy NOT dependent on colour alone
2. Button shape contrast: minimum 3:1
3. Button text contrast: minimum 4.5:1
4. If identical button styles, contrast between them: minimum 3:1
5. Target area: minimum 48pt x 48pt
6. Space between buttons: at least 16pt

## Use a Single Primary Button for the Most Important Action

**Guidelines:**
- Primary button = most important action
- Helps people understand what to do next
- If no single most important action, use secondary/tertiary
- AVOID multiple primary buttons (compete for attention, cause confusion)

**Multiple primary buttons cause:**
- Interface clutter
- Confused visual hierarchy
- If everything is important, nothing stands out

## Use Secondary Buttons for Less Important Actions

**Use for:**
- Alternative to primary action
- Multiple actions with equal importance

**When actions have equal importance:**
- Use equal prominence (both secondary)
- Don't bias one over other

**Example:** "Report email as junk?" - Report / Don't report (both secondary)

## Use Tertiary Buttons for the Least Important Actions

**Best for:**
- Displaying multiple actions
- Destructive actions you want less prominent

**Benefits:**
- Low prominence
- Corrects visual hierarchy
- Makes primary action most prominent
- Helps avoid accidental destructive actions

## Try to Avoid Disabled Buttons

**Problems with disabled buttons:**
- Can cause people to get stuck (no feedback on WHY)
- Low contrast - hard for poor eyesight to see
- Not keyboard accessible - confuses keyboard users

### Alternative 1: Enable buttons and validate on submit
- Display error messages when submitted
- Instantly shows what was missed
- Simple, accessible solution

### Alternative 2: Remove unavailable actions
- Remove unavailable actions entirely
- Let people know WHY unavailable
- Reduces confusion, creates clear focus

### Alternative 3: Lock icon on unavailable actions
- Put lock icon on regular buttons
- Indicates unavailable/locked
- Ensures discoverability and sufficient contrast
- Works well for premium features
- Let people know how to get access

### If You Must Use Disabled Buttons
- Include message near button explaining why unavailable
- Add tooltip explaining why unavailable
- Make button keyboard accessible (allows focus for assistive technology)

## Left Align Buttons

Order buttons left to right, most important to least important.

**Reasons:**
- English read left to right, F-pattern
- Right-aligned buttons can be missed on large screens
- Screen magnifier users might miss right-aligned buttons
- Most important button should have lowest interaction cost

### Mobile Screens
- Stack buttons top to bottom
- Most important at top
- Make buttons full-width (both hands can reach)

### Small Dialog Boxes
Both left and right alignment can work if visual hierarchy is clear.

**Left alignment reasons:**
- Familiar pattern (Windows OS)
- Consistent with other forms
- Avoids confusion from mixed alignment

**Right alignment reasons:**
- Indicates direction/momentum (forward = right, back = left)
- Familiar pattern (Mac OS)

### Multi-Step Forms
**Problem with right-aligned primary button:**
- Back button in prominent left position = accidental clicks
- Primary button further from form fields = higher interaction cost
- Right-aligned buttons missed on large screens

**Solution:**
- Keep primary button left-aligned
- Put tertiary "Back" button at top left:
  - Common position (mobile, browsers, breadcrumbs)
  - Allows going back without scrolling
  - Less chance of accidental data loss

### Exception: Single Form Fields
For search/email subscription:
- Primary button on right of field saves space
- Connection reinforces relationship
- Ensures button isn't missed

## Ensure Button Text Describes the Action

Button text = meaningful when read out of context.

**Rule:** Verb (action) + Noun (thing)

**Examples:**
- "Save post"
- "Discard message"
- "Edit article"

**Why descriptive:**
- Prominent buttons viewed first
- Allows quick action without reading supporting text
- Screen reader users jump to buttons/links

**Bad:** "Ok", "Submit", "Yes"
**Good:** "Save post", "Update payment details", "Delete article"

## Ensure Buttons Have a Sufficient Target Size

Small targets = harder to click/touch (especially motor impairments or one-handed use).

**Guidelines:**
- Minimum 48pt x 48pt
- Frequently used buttons: even larger
- Separate buttons by at least 8pt

**Small interactive elements:**
- Extend target area beyond visual bounds
- Indicate target area to reduce interaction cost

## Balance Icon and Text Pairs

Ensure same visual prominence for cohesive look.

### Use Similar Weight
Match icon and text thickness - groups them together, creates balance.

### Use Similar Size
Match icon size to text size.

### Vary Contrast
If weight/size hard to match, use contrast for balance.
- Large/thick icons: use "Stroke strong" colour
- Text: use "Text weak" colour

## Add Friction to Destructive Actions

**Destructive action:** Causes harm or can't be undone.

**Friction:** Increases interaction cost to perform action.

**Apply increasing friction based on severity:**

### Initial Friction (Before action)
- Make action less prominent
- Move further away
- Progressively disclose
- DON'T colour red (makes more prominent)

### Light Friction (Less serious)
Simple confirmation message.
"Delete message? Are you sure you want to delete this message?"

### Moderate Friction
Highlight confirmation in red to warn of destructive action.
"Delete article? You won't be able to recover it."

### Heavy Friction (Very destructive)
Red + checkbox that must be selected before action can occur.
"Delete account? [checkbox] I confirm I want to delete my account"

### Prefer Undo Over Confirmation Dialogs

UX research shows confirmation dialogs are ineffective - users click through them automatically without reading. Undo is almost always better.

**Undo pattern:**
1. Execute action immediately
2. Show toast: "Email deleted. [Undo]"
3. Actually delete after toast expires (5-10 seconds)

**Benefits:**
- Doesn't interrupt workflow
- Users don't have to think before acting
- Mistakes are easily recoverable
- Feels faster and more responsive

**Use confirmation dialogs ONLY for:**
- Truly irreversible actions (account deletion)
- High-cost actions (payments)
- Batch operations affecting many items

**Example - Gmail style:**
```
"Message deleted. [Undo]"  ← Toast with undo option
```

Even with friction, mistakes happen. Undo removes a lot of risk while maintaining flow.

## Chapter Summary
